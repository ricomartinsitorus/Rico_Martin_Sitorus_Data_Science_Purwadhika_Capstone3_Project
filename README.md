This repository contains the machine learning model to predict the apartment price

BUSINESS CONTEXT : 

- Apartments serve as a primary solution to housing needs in urban environments, especially due to limited land availability and high levels of business activity.
- Apartment prices are significantly influenced by various internal factors (e.g., size, facilities within the apartment) and external factors (e.g., proximity to public facilities and transportation).
- The goal of this analysis is to understand and predict apartment prices to help property owners and buyers set prices that align with market conditions
